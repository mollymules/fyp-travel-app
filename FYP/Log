Problem: couldn't get stuff from DS with key
Solution: had to use __key__
Problem: jQuery mobile not rendering when content is dynamically loaded. 
Solution: had to call .trigger("create") to initialise
Problem: Everytime page was added, kept appending the same content repeatedly
Solution: Surround with while loop to check if content has already been added. Didnt work 
$("#disPage").live('pageinit', function(): change live to bind
Lesson: every link uses an AJAX call to retrieve the contents of the page<div>, the head never gets run, only once at start.
